# Superstore Sales, Profits, and Customers Visualization

This project is a data visualization of the Superstore Sales, Profits, and Customers  dataset using Tableau. The dataset contains sales and profit data for a fictional superstore.

Using Tableau, I have created a series of interactive dashboards and charts to explore and analyze the data. Some of the questions I have attempted to answer include:

> What are the overall trends in sales and profits over time?

> How does the performance of different product categories vary?

> What factors contribute to higher profits?

> How does the performance of different regions compare?

> How does the performance of different customers vary?

By interacting with the dashboards, you can filter and drill down into the data to find your own insights and trends.

The visualization is hosted on Tableau Public and can be accessed using the link below: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vipul.soni/viz/Sample_superstore_sales_profits_customersDataViz_usingTableau/CustomerDashboard
